## _**My first calculator that was created with <ins>Javascript</ins>, <ins>HTML</ins> and <ins>CSS</ins>.**_ 🇧🇷

It was hard and I did have some troubles with Javascript and even harder with CSS, but at least everything worked out!

### _**Update 12/2022**_ 🚩
* I've started a node project.
* Add <ins>**Typescript**</ins> to project.
* Build code style with <ins>**Eslint**</ins>.
* And set it to be deployed with Github Action <ins>**CI/CD**</ins> at marge in master.
