## _**My first calculator that was created with Javascript, HTML and CSS.**_ 🇧🇷

It was hard and I did have some troubles with Javascript and even harder with CSS, but at least everything worked out!

In december 2022, I've started a node project, add Typescript and code style with Eslint to project.
And set it to be deployed with Github Action at merge in master branch.
